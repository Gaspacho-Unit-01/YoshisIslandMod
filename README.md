# YoshisIslandMod
The official GitHub for the Yoshi's Island Terraria Mod


Step By Guide to using GitHub:

Here's the dealio, GitHub is a tadbit complicated so here is the rundown:

- The branches tab just to the upper left allows us to work on seperate, yet identical copies of the mod

- in order to add files directly to GitHub you need to click on the modfolder and navigate it as you would
  any normal file path. and click on the "add files" to upload files.
