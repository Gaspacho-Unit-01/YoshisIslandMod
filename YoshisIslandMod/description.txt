>>IMPORTANT NOTES<<

-It is highly recommended that you DO NOT start right off the bat on expert mode. Take time to prepare and build yourself up before jumping into the mod. All enemy NPC's have been buffed and nerfed accordingly and in expert mode, they'll eat you alive if you're not prepared. You've been warned!

-DON'T USE THE ULTIMATE RAINBOW BABY CLOWN COPTER AT ALL IF YOU'RE PRONE TO SEIZURES. Just to be safe!

-Everything you see here is a work in progress and subject to change in the future. The things in the mod aren't completely finalized yet and if there's something you feel is off, we'll check it out and see if it needs to be worked on- BUT the ONLY way we'll know about what's on your mind is if you leave us feedback on our discord server!

-In the future we plan on adding special pets, items, bosses and weapons.

-We're currently working on making *YET ANOTHER* functional Town NPC that will sell or trade extremely helpful materials related to clown copters and other items in the mod.

-In the future, Clown Copters *MAY* be moved to another mod called "Yoshis Island Chroma Pack" where all multicolored and scrapped things will be moved to. In advance, everyone will be notified about the *potential* move and the clown copters will be turned into materials to refund you for your efforts. Underline, May and Potential. 

--Feedback is greatly appreciated and we take everything into consideration. We want to provide the best experience for you and make this mod the best we can so if you feel like something needs a change, please let us know on our discord server!
